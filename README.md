## History
Early stages of Mavoric were originally developed for the [OwnagePE](shop.ownagepe.com) network, 
after multiple failed attempts at making something functional, Mavoric was then taken into private development 
for improvements and shortly after made an appearance on [Versai](versai.pro) in August 2019 where it has been 
used on a mass scale to help improve it's overall functionality.
